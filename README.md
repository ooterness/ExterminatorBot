# ExterminatorBot
Prototype of a [Reddit bot](https://www.reddit.com/user/ExterminatorBot) for finding and flagging certain types of spam.

# Goals
For now, the primary goals for this project are to find identify specific types of spam:
* (Functional) Karma-farmers that copy-paste old popular posts.
* (Coming soon?) Redbubble scammers selling knockoff mugs and T-shirts.

It's astonishing how little Reddit administrators do to stop these obvious bots.

By default, the bot acts in "read-only" mode to detect spammers.
If configured, the bot can also take action against high-confidence spam posts.
Actions are enabled separately, and include filing reports and posting comment replies.
Before enabling such actions, please coordinate with subreddit moderators.
