# ExterminatorBot
Prototype of a [Reddit bot](https://www.reddit.com/user/ExterminatorBot) for finding and flagging certain types of spam.

# Goals
For now, the primary goals for this project are to find identify specific types of spam:
* Karma-farmers that copy-paste old popular posts.
* Redbubble scammers selling knockoff mugs and T-shirts.

It's astonishing how little Reddit administrators do to stop these obvious bots.

At present, ExterminatorBot is "read-only" and takes no further action.
It's just running experiments to see if the concept is worth pursuing further.

If these experiments succeed, the next step is to contact moderators of specific subreddits.
If they opt-in, then high-confidence alarms may post comments, file reports, or take other actions.
